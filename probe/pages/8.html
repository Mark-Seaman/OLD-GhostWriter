                    <p>by Mark Seaman</p>
                    <p>Humans Tell Stories

Story telling is fundamental to the human experience. Stories are intended to impact both the intellect and the emotions. Stories call people to take action because behavior is controlled by our emotions.

We can all relate to the feeling of knowing what we must do but feeling powerless to do it for lack of motivation. Once the emotions are stirred then we find the will to do what is needed. Feelings are the fire that drives the engine.

We like to believe that humans are rational beings that emote, but in reality we are emotional beings that rationalize. Emotions always drive behavior, and the intellect attempts to come up with a decent rationalization.

A great story motivates and guides by engaging both the heart and the head. While the intellect may guide us in the right direction, it is necessary to touch the emotions to get us to move.</p>

                    <h2>From the Edge of Reality</h2>
                    <p>by Mark Seaman</p>
                    <p>What is poetry?  While prose seeks to enlighten, poetry seeks to inspire. 
Authors speak the language of the head, but poets speak the language of the
heart and the gut.  Words of logic are no match for words of passion.

Two views of reality ... one of the waking world ... one of the dream world. 
The world is filled with issues of politics, economics, survival, and conflict.
In this domain the laws of science rule.  Cause and Effect, Quantum Mechanics,
and Entropy.  Logic is king and every problem has a solution.

But there is another reality. When we sleep we enter another reality where
spirits move. This reality is driven by emotion and instinct.  It is impossible
to look at straight on.  But it is always in our peripheral vision.  It is the
domain of ecstasy and terror.  It is the reason to live,  yet this world
threatens our sanity if unaware or obsessed with it.</p>

                    <h2>One man&#x27;s search for truth</h2>
                    <p>by Mark Seaman</p>
                    <p>After a lifetime of trying to find meaning in life I finally feel ready to share what I&#x27;ve learned. Why do I exist?  This is the question that I have grappled with for decades. 
Early on, I knew that there must be some higher purpose for my existence.  In my
teen years, I embraced easy and trite answers that others told me were true.

But these simple answers to my life purpose never seemed complete and left me
wanting  a much fuller explanation.  Over the five decades since I have toyed
with many explanations before settling on the one you will read about here. 
After actively seeking for the meaning of life I believe that I now understand
some truths  well enough to share with others.

The is a record of my journey of personal understanding.   It is a long time in
the making.  I started my journey seeking enlightenment at age 13, and at age 60
finally had the breakthrough that I had been seeking most of my life.  </p>
