    <h1>Under the Mushroom Cloud</h1>
<p>by <a href="https://markseaman.org" target="_new">Mark Seaman</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The flash was unbelievably bright.  It is hard to imagine that anything could be
so intensely brilliant. The hands over their eyes did little to block the light.</p>
<p>Dave crouched in a foxhole with his buddy that was only three deep. He wore
standard battle gear, helmet, and standard light jacket.  He could not help but
wonder if it was enough to save him.</p>
<p>They were told to remain as low in the foxhole as possible until the first
shock-wave had passed over them.  This took a number of seconds after the
initial detonation.  Waiting … waiting … waiting .. sheer terror. Superheated
air driving an atomic hurricane of death.</p>
<p>Dave's neck got a bad sunburn in the gap between his helmet and jacket. After
the initial blast had passed over them the soldiers were able to stand up in the
foxholes and watch the show.  As the blast radius continued outward it set fire
to phosphorous pots that were used to mark the progress of the advancing 
shock-wave.  The wave of destruction expanded outward for perhaps ten miles, 
well past their point at four miles from the blast.</p>
<p>The bomb had been set to go off 3,400 feet above the ground to minimize the
amount of fallout that would be created. A humongous ball of fire was roiling
well off the ground.  The high temperatures of the super heated air were
converting the fireball into a giant floating donut of fire. The heat naturally
produces the characteristic mushroom cloud shape that is the ultimate symbol of
death and destruction.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/images/seamansguide.com/journey/Tscharli1.jpg" /></p>
<p>As astonishing as this was to watch, the soldiers needed to remain extremely
focused. Dave was keeping a silent count as he watched the cloud.  One - Two -
Thirty-one - Thirty-two - Thirty-three. The superheated air from the blast 
forced out and produced a vacuum. This would not last long.  Nature abhors a 
vacuum and soon the air would be rushing back in to fill it.</p>
<p>The soldiers had been briefed on  exactly how many seconds they had to enjoy the
show.  Dave was diligently focused and got down again at the correct time.
Others were not so fortunate. They became distracted by the intensity of the
emotions they felt.</p>
<p>The air returning caused a second blast wave filled with lots of debris that had
become loosened from the initial blast wave. The returning air was still fairly
hot and knocked the distracted soldiers out of their foxholes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/images/seamansguide.com/journey/Buster-Dog-500.jpg" /></p>
<p>Now for the hard part. They were ordered out of the foxholes for a march across
the atomic wasteland. The dust was as fine as powdered-sugar and with each step
their boot sank into the dust. They marched the four miles to ground-zero of the
blast.  Step after step in the deadly dust.</p>
<p>Along the march they passed various structures and vehicles and dead and dying
animals that had been stationed at  different distances from the blast.  Dave
could never forget these things.</p>
<p>Once at ground-zero the soldiers were covered with radioactive dust. They were
swept off with kitchen brooms trying not to breathe too deeply.  Their dress was
standard fatigues without even a heavy coat.  They had no protective clothing
and no breathing equipment or radiation equipment.  The soldier did not wear
dosimeters to record how much radiation they had received but when they got to
ground-zero the technicians had Geiger Counters that were signing away.</p>
<p>The soldiers were ordered to perform physical and mental exercises. They
competed to break-down and reassemble firearms and other activities that tested
their ability to capture territory from some future enemy. The purpose of the
overall exercise was to understand how tactical nuclear weapons might be used on
the battlefield.  Operation Desert Rock involved 6,500 troops as part of seven
different phases.</p>
<p>In some detonations a number of structures had been constructed to simulate a
small town.  You may have seen the video footage of the small town constructed
near Frenchman Flats. These included apartment buildings, multi-level stores,
houses, highway overpasses, and bomb shelters. Most of these structures were
devastated within a few seconds. The officials wanted to know just what would
survive when the inevitable happened. Most could not survive the initial nuclear
wind.</p>
<p>Corporal Paul David Seaman participated in the Operation Tumbler–Snapper. He was
one of 535 troops chosen as 
observers (with another 1,675 troops doing
maneuvers) as part of Operation Desert Rock IV.  Dave was one of the 150 men
ordered to participate from Company B, 167th Infantry Regiment, 31st Division, US Army.
The detonation was named Charlie and
occurred on April 22, 1952 and yielded the equivalent power to 31 Kilotons
of TNT.</p>
<p>Dave wondered what would become of him as a consequence of this exercise.
Soldiers did not wear dosimeters  to record the radiation that they received
during the test, so it is  impossible to know the exact amount. What would the
real consequences of their exposure ultimately be?  No one knew but it was
likely to be very bad indeed.</p>
<p>There are sometimes that having a vivid imagination can be terribly cruel. Would
his hair fall out, lose skin, grow sick, or would there only be long term
consequences like leukemia or thyroid cancer?  Would he ever be able have
children and if so would they be deformed?</p>
<p>Dave turned out to be one of the lucky ones, although there were some serious
consequences from the radiation.  For the next five years he was
unable to conceive any children while trying very hard, but eventually my father
went one to have three normal children.</p>
<p>He has also had ongoing problems with thyroid tumors that require regular monitoring.
But considering how many of his peers fared his health history is remarkable.
He survives to this day and recently celebrated his 87th birthday.</p>
<p>He is one of the few people alive to have had such a close encounter with an angry
atomic bomb. But that day in the Nevada desert will certainly never be
forgotten.</p>
