<h2>About the Book</h2>
<p><img src="/static/images/shrinking-world.com/training/PythonWebApps.jpg.400.jpg" alt="Building Python Web Apps" /></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Teaching programming skills presents some unique challenges. Reading a book and listening to
lectures can't teach you the necessary skills to be a proficient programmer. You learn to code by
putting your hands on the keyboard and doing it. After working for 25 years as a software engineer
and a software process architect at HP, I owned a custom software engineering company for 12 years,
and then 5 years ago began teaching web development as an Adjunct Professor at the University of
Northern Colorado. I understand what it takes to succeed right out of college, and I have a passion
for preparing students for their first job.</p>
<p>This textbook is the result of 5 years of fine-tuning my approach to teaching web development. I was
dismayed by the first textbooks I reviewed. They were heavy on memorizing terms and abstract
concepts and very light on actual programming assignments. I have practiced the disciplines of
Agile Software development since its earliest days, and I've applied that same mindset to
teaching.</p>
<p>The fastest way to learn coding is to write code, see it fail, and learn how to fix it. This
textbook presents the basic concepts of web development with Python in 14 chapters that easily map
onto a 15-week semester. Each chapter has a discussion of the key concept, discrete skills, and
demo code, and culminates with a project.</p>
<p>The quickest way to learn programming skills is to immediately start programming. Every task is
difficult the first time, but you quickly learn with practice. With each victory, there is new
knowledge that is retained for the next time you see a similar situation. You must form new neural
pathways in your brain, and these are formed as you use creativity to solve problems. By the end of
this book, you will have enough experience to build apps commercially using the skills you have
gained.</p>
<h3>Who is this Book For?</h3>
<p>This textbook will teach you how to build web applications efficiently. It does not assume any
programming experience beyond the ability to read Python code. If you can read Python, then you can
learn to write it by studying the example code in each chapter.</p>
<p>During this course, you will learn everything you need to know about the tools and techniques that
are needed to build and deploy a commercial web application. We will start by installing
development tools and creating projects using a powerful web framework (Django) and deploying these
to a web hosting service.</p>
<h3>Learning Progression</h3>
<p>There are about 50 skills that are required to build an application. Each of the 14 chapters
introduces new skills. Each project is based on learning these skills. Each time you apply a skill
it gets easier. Each project is scoped to require and verify the learning as you go.</p>
<p>The skills learned for one project will carry forward to all the later projects. This builds
automatic responses and reinforces the learning. By the end of the course, you will have lots of
practice in doing the routine tasks that you learned early on. These activities will be automatic
and will require very little conscious thought.</p>
<p>Each project builds on the previous ones. All 14 projects will work together to produce a
medium-sized commercial web application.</p>
<p><strong>App Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Built on the latest free development tools</li>
<li>Hosted on the free commercial web hosting server</li>
<li>Database to store info</li>
<li>User administration</li>
<li>Views to present data</li>
<li>Editing via forms</li>
<li>CRUD operations for all data models</li>
<li>Automatic tests</li>
<li>Styling with Bootstrap</li>
<li>Reusable data widgets</li>
<li>Refactoring and design patterns</li>
<li>Image upload</li>
<li>Data import/export</li>
<li>Engineering practices</li>
<li>Internet Resources</li>
</ul>
<h3>College Class vs. Personal Learning</h3>
<p>This course requires about 100 hours of concentrated effort and focused practice. Investing that
amount of energy will enable you to build apps on your own successfully. Additional time is
required to get quicker at the skills and get stuck less often, but this course will prepare you to
write commercial apps professionally.</p>
<p>This textbook is also ideal for personal learning outside the classroom. Anyone that invests 100
hours will learn the skills to build a modern web app. This could be used for On-The-Job Training
or professional development.</p>
<p>The internet is full of excellent free resources to help you in specific situations. There are links
throughout this textbook for additional learning content.</p>
<h3>Pair Programming</h3>
<p>I recommend that you team up with someone else to learn this together. Learning goes faster with a
buddy. It gives you someone to discuss confusing issues with and someone to help you when you get
stuck.</p>
<p>In the real world, pair programming is common. Two people write one chunk of code and discuss it as
they go. Bugs get squashed before they make it into the code and the peer pressure naturally
increases the quality and quantity of the work.</p>
